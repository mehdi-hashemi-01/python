# Python Lecture Repository

This repo hosts the official exercises and examples used in my Python classes. Each folder corresponds to a lecture session and contains:
- Concise demo scripts that illustrate the day‚Äôs topic
- Hands-on practice tasks with starter code and expected output
- Inline comments and mini-READMEs that explain the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind every snippet

Clone the repository and work through the folders in order. Solve each exercise before peeking at the reference solutions. Issues and pull requests are welcome‚Äîhappy coding!
